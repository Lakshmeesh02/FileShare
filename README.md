# FileShare
File sharing using socket programming in python

1) Specify the host variable in both files with the IP address of the wannabe server
2) Connect 2 devices-one being the client and the other being the server
3) Follow the command line instructions on the client side to get/post a file from/to the server

NOTE: The file can be an image, a pdf, a word doc or a video too!
