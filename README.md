# FileShare
File sharing using socket programming in python

1) Save the server.py file in a different folder
2) The folder which contains client.py file must have a file to send to the server
3) Run both the scripts and follow the instructions
4) The folder with server.py will have a copy of the sent file... Voila!

NOTE: The file can be an image, a pdf, a word doc or a video too! Find out if a music file can be sent or not :)
